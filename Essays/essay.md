# Briefing on Funding for Digital Commons #

This memo will analyse which funding model is most effective in supporting and furthering digital commons and present an alternative where funding mechanisms are unavailable. 

## Context: Importance of funding for digital commons ##

Digital commons have become an essential part of the world’s digital infrastructure and a key driver of economic activity (Eghbal, 2016). Despite the critical role of these commons in ensuring digital sovereignty they are often governed by citizen communities on a voluntary basis with limited resources (European Working Team on Digital Commons, 2022, p. 2). Policies that offer financial policy instruments are essential for the long-term sustainability of digital commons. While a number of digital commons policies have been introduced, they vary in the type of funding provided.

## 1. Types of public fundings to drive development and adoption ##

Prizes and grants are the two most common types of public funding mechanisms that are provided through the digital commons policies identified in the NGI Commons Database.  They are both aimed at directly supporting the creation and adoption of digital commons. These two differing approaches, exemplified by France and Austria, will be compared below. 

    1.1. <u>Prizes foster grassroots communities</u>
    
    France’s *Action Plan for Free Software and Digital Commons (2021)* includes the BlueHats initiative which awards four prizes of €10,000 annually to developers contributing to open-source solutions. These prizes are aimed at incentivising participation in digital commons and sustaining the community of users who do the most maintenance. Prizes as a funding mechanism avoids the issue of needing to quantify the value that has been created through the digital commons or the value that the common promises to create, which is often an element that is traditionally considered by regulatory authorities when determining whether to allocate funds (Osborne et al., 2024). These prizes have been shown to stimulate the specific community and also benefit the broader commons ecosystem yet there is a risk that reliance on one-off awards may limit the long-term effectiveness of this funding mechanism. 

   1.2. <u>Grants for private-sector projects to stimulate the economy</u>

   Austria’s *AT Program (2016)* allocates up to €200,000 per project to private-sector-led open-source initiatives. By focusing on larger grants, this policy seeks to foster substantive and scalable projects and encourage digital start-ups and small and medium-sized businesses to be involved with digital commons (HILLENIUS, 2016). Through grants, the Austrian regulator can direct innovation to engage with specific high-priority projects like eGovernment, eHealth and eLearning. This benefits not only Austria’s economy but also its digital sovereignty. One criticism of this approach is that it is only directed to businesses, creating potential tensions with the existing digital commons communities that are made up of passionate individuals.

## 2. Beyond funding: capacity building for digital commons ##

While funding for digital commons is critical, other forms of support through digital commons policies can be useful if financing mechanisms are not available like capacity building policies. These policies seek to equip stakeholders with the skills, tools, and resources needed to engage with digital commons. It strengthens the long-term viability of digital commons by ensuring stakeholders have the necessary expertise and infrastructure to build a sustainable digital commons. 

2.1. <u>Different approaches to capacity building</u>

The *Common European Data Spaces (2023)* provides technical assistance to stakeholders, fostering collaboration among public institutions, private enterprises and civil society organisations. Together, stakeholders establish standardised, interoperable data-sharing frameworks across sectors. While the EU’s cross-sectoral approach encourages inclusive participation it is difficult to measure the tangible impact of this policy. In contrast, *France’s Action Plan (2021)* provides technical assistance programs for public institutions, helping them transition to open-source technologies. This hands-on approach reduces the barriers to adoption and supports alignment with the policy’s broader goal of digital sovereignty. Having a targeted goal of building capability within one group allows the regulator to measure the effectiveness of the policy.
